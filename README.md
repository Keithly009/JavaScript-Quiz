# JavaScript-Quiz 
The purpose of this assignment was to create a quiz using HTML, CSS and Javascript. The details of this quiz revolved around asking the participant questions about 
Javascript. The questions will be asked under a timely manner, and if the time runs out it would force the individual into a "GameOver Screen" where their results
will be displayed. In this there will be a list of other scores displayed before the user, along with the option of refreshing or removing the prior scores that are
stored in the local storage leaving you with a blank slate. There were references from tutorials alongside aid from fellow classmates to help with the code, however as 
of now (10/25/2022) the code still remains without functionality.
